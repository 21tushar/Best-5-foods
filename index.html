      <h2>1. Buttered popcorn, United States</h2>

        “There is no love sincerer than the love of food,” George Bernard Shaw
        said. Judging by the number of amazing dishes out there, he was right.
        Corn the workhorse of the industrial world is best when its sweet
        variety is fried up with lashings of butter till it bursts and then
        snarfed in greasy fistfuls while watching Netflix late at night.

      <h2>2. Masala dosa, India</h2>

        A crispy, rice-batter crepe encases a spicy mix of mashed potato, which
        is then dipped in coconut chutney, pickles, tomato-and-lentil-based
        sauces and other condiments. It is a fantastic breakfast food that will
        keep you going till lunch, when you will probably come back for another.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h2>3. Potato chips, United Kingdom</h2>
      <br />

        It is unclear when and where the potato chip was born. US legend has it
        that they were invented in New York in 1853, but the earliest known
        recipe for “Potatoes Fried in Slices or Shavings” appears in a
        bestselling 1817 cookbook by Englishman William Kitchiner. Whatever the
        case, they are now one of the world’s most child-friendly and best
        foods. But think of them this way if a single chip cost, say, $5, it
        would be a far greater (and more popular) delicacy than caviar, a prize
        worth fighting wars over.

      <h2>4. Seafood paella, Spain</h2>
      <br />

        The sea is lapping just by your feet, a warm breeze whips the tablecloth
        around your legs and a steamy pan of paella sits in front of you.
        Shrimp, lobster, mussels and cuttlefish combine with white rice and
        various herbs, oil and salt in this Valencian dish to send you
        immediately into holiday mode. Though if you have it in Spain, you are
        probably there already.

        If Malcolm Gladwell says it is a perfect food, then it is a perfect
        food. Let’s face it, anything that can convince 2-year-olds to eat their
        carrots rather than spitting them onto the floor is worthy of not just a
        “delicious” title, but a “miracle of persuasion” title, too.
